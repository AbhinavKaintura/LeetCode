Let me break down the approaches and their optimization strategies:

Brute Force Approach (findSubstring_bruteforce):

Generate all possible permutations of words
Time Complexity: O(n * m! * k), where n is string length, m is number of words, k is word length
Very inefficient for large inputs
Simple to understand but impractical for real-world use
Generates all possible word combinations beforehand


Sliding Window with Hash Map (findSubstring_sliding_window):

Uses frequency counting of words
Time Complexity: O(n * m * k), where n is string length, m is number of words, k is word length
Checks each possible starting index
Validates by tracking word frequencies
More efficient than brute force
Handles repeated words correctly


Optimized Sliding Window (findSubstring_optimized):

Most efficient approach
Time Complexity: O(n * k), where n is string length, k is word length
Key Optimizations:
a) Only checks specific starting points based on word length
b) Uses a sliding window technique
c) Dynamically adjusts window based on word frequencies
d) Reduces unnecessary iterations
Handles edge cases like repeated words
Minimizes redundant checks



Key Optimization Strategies:

Use of hash maps for frequency tracking
Sliding window technique to reduce iterations
Preprocessing word frequencies
Early termination of invalid sequences
Minimizing redundant computations

The third approach is the most recommended due to its efficiency and ability to handle complex scenarios with minimal computational overhead.
